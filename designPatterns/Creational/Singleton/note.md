## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is useful when you need to have a single instance of a class that manages a resource or when you need to enforce a strict control over the creation and access of an object.

To implement the Singleton pattern, we need to consider the following key components:

Private Constructor: The class should have a private constructor to prevent external instantiation.

Static Instance: A static member variable that holds the single instance of the class.

Static Access Method: A static method that provides access to the instance. This method should ensure that only one instance is created and returned.

Thread Safety: In multi-threaded environments, we need to ensure that the instance creation is thread-safe.

Example - Creating connection to Database
